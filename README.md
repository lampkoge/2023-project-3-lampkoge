In the worst case, the complexity of both insert and search is O(n), while in the average case, it is O(1) for both operations. Regarding real-time performance, the complexity of insert and search is ùëÇ(1)O(1), and the same applies to amortized time, which is also O(1). Compared to the classic implementation, the hybrid approach has the same average case and amortized time complexity but demonstrates better worst-case complexity due to the use of separate chaining.
